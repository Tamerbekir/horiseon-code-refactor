# User Story

## As a marketing agency
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<br>
WHEN I view the source code
<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<br>
WHEN I view the image elements
<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes
<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order
<br>
WHEN I view the title element
<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
<br>

# Description 

**For HTML**
<br>
Refactored the webpage to make it accessible to all users by adding semantic elements to the HTML layout. Also made the webpage accessible by adding placeholders for images thus giving the user the ability to see image descriptions if the image does not render, or for those who use a screen reader. The HTML layout was also rearranged to have a cleaner look by putting like elements together in an easy-to-read format. Fixed broken links that did not redirect the user to the correct section of the webpage.

**For CSS**
<br>
The CSS stylesheet was rearranged by simplifying the attributes by eliminating redundant sections and excessive wording. 
<br>
<br>
Added comments to both the HTML and CSS indicating all changes that were made.
